# Pachyderm Examples
**Pachyderm Examples** is a curated list of examples that use Pachyderm to accomplish various tasks. 

## Machine Learning

- [Breast Cancer Detection](./breast-cancer-detection) - A breast cancer detection system based on radiology scans scaled and visualized using Pachyderm.
- [Boston Housing Prices](./housing-prices) - A machine learning pipeline to train a regression model on the Boston Housing Dataset to predict the value of homes.
- [Boston Housing Prices (Intermediate)](./housing-prices-intermediate) - Extends the original Boston Housing Prices example to show a multi-pipeline DAG and data rollbacks. 
- [Market Sentiment](./market-sentiment) - Train and deploy a fully automated financial market sentiment BERT model. As data is manually labeled, the model will automatically retrain and deploy. 

## Data Labeling

- [Label Studio Integration](./label-studio) - Incorporate data versioning into any labeling project with Label Studio and the Pachyderm S3 Gateway. 


## Other Integrations

- [ClearML Integration](https://github.com/JimmyWhitaker/pach_clearml) - Log Pachyderm experiments to ClearML's experiment montioring platform, using Pachyderm Secrets.
